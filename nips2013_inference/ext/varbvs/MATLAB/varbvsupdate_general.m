% [ALPHA,MU,XR] = VARBVSUPDATE(X,SIGMA,SA,LOGODDS,XY,D,ALPHA0,MU0,XR0,I)
% runs a single iteration of the coordinate ascent updates to maximize the
% variational lower bound for Bayesian variable selection in linear
% regression. It adjusts the fully-factorized variational approximation to
% the posterior distribution of the coefficients in a linear regression
% model of a continuous outcome (quantitiative trait), with spike and slab
% priors on the coefficients.
%
% All inputs to this function are required. Input X is an N x P matrix of
% observations about the variables (or features), where N is the number of
% samples, and P is the number of variables. Input XY = X'*Y, where Y is the
% vector of observations about the outcome. Crucially, to account for an
% intercept, Y and X must be centered beforehand so that Y and each column
% of X has a mean of zero.
%
% This routine is implemented with the assumption that X is a single
% floating-point precision matrix (type HELP SINGLE), as opposed to the
% MATLAB default of double precision. This is useful for large data sets,
% because single precision requires half of the number of bits as double
% floating-point precision. If X is provided in another numerical
% representation, an error is reported.
%
% Inputs SIGMA, SA and LOGODDS specify the hyperparameters. SIGMA and SA are
% scalars. SIGMA specifies the variance of the residual, and SA*SIGMA is the
% prior variance of the regression coefficients. LOGODDS is the prior
% log-odds of inclusion for each variable. It is equal to LOGODDS =
% LOG(Q./(1-Q)), where Q is the prior probability that each variable is
% included in the linear model of Y. LOGODDS is a vector of length P.
%
% Inputs ALPHA0, MU0 are the current parameters of the variational
% approximation; under the variational approximation, the ith regression
% coefficient is normal with probability ALPHA0(i), and MU0(i) is the mean
% of the coefficient given that it is included in the model. Inputs XR0 and
% D must be XR0 = X*(ALPHA0.*MU0) and D = DIAG(X'*X).
%
% Input I specifies the order in which the coordinates are updated. It may
% be a vector of any length. Each entry of I must be an integer between 1
% and P.
%
% There are three outputs. Output vectors ALPHA and MU are the updated
% variational parameters, and XR = X*(ALPHA.*MU). The computational
% complexity of VARBVSUPDATE is O(N*LENGTH(I)).
