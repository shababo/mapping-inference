% [LNZ,ALPHA,MU,S] = VARBVS(X,Y,SIGMA,SA,LOGODDS) implements the
% fully-factorized variational approximation for Bayesian variable selection
% in linear regression. It finds the "best" fully-factorized variational
% approximation to the posterior distribution of the coefficients in a
% linear regression model of a continuous outcome (quantitiative trait),
% with spike and slab priors on the coefficients. By "best", we mean the
% approximating distribution that locally minimizes the Kullback-Leibler
% divergence between the approximating distribution and the exact posterior.
%
% The required inputs are as follows. Input X is an N x P matrix of
% observations about the variables (or features), where N is the number of
% samples, and P is the number of variables. Y is the vector of observations
% about the outcome; it is a vector of length N. To account for an
% intercept, Y and X must be centered beforehand so that Y and each column
% of X has a mean of zero. 
%
% Note that this routine is implemented with the assumption that the data X
% is single floating-point precision (type HELP SINGLE), as opposed to the
% MATLAB default of double precision. This is useful for large data sets,
% because single precision requires half of the number of bits as double
% floating-point precision. If X is provided in another numerical
% representation, it is immediately converted to SINGLE.
%
% Inputs SIGMA, SA and LOGODDS are the hyperparameters. SIGMA and SA are
% scalars. SIGMA specifies the variance of the residual, and SA*SIGMA is the
% prior variance of the coefficients. LOGODDS is the prior log-odds of
% inclusion for each variable. It is equal to LOGODDS = LOG(Q./(1-Q)), where
% Q is the prior probability that each variable is included in the linear
% model of Y (i.e. the prior probability that its coefficient is not zero).
% LOGODDS may either be a scalar, in which case all the variables have the
% same prior inclusion probability, or it may be a vector of length P.
%
% There are four outputs. Output scalar LNZ is the variational estimate of
% the marginal log-likelihood given the hyperparameters SIGMA, SA and
% LOGODDS.
%
% Outputs ALPHA, MU and S are the parameters of the variational
% approximation and, equivalently, variational estimates of posterior
% quantites: under the variational approximation, the ith regression
% coefficient is normal with probability ALPHA(i); MU(i) and S(i) are the
% mean and variance of the coefficient given that it is included in the
% model. Outputs ALPHA, MU and S are all column vectors of length P.
%

% OPTIONS.ALPHA and OPTIONS.MU to override the random initialization of
